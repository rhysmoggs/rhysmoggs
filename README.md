Having graduated with a Diploma in Web Application Development from Code Institute, I am happily a career changer.  
Previously, I held supervisory and team leader roles for hugely successful companies in the UK and Australia and have over 10 years of experience working within the telecommunications, energy and financial sectors.  

I have built 4 main projects (with a portfolio to soon follow) and have collaborated on both personal and professional projects along with a Hackathon - a finance budget calculator and currency converter.

I am currently studying towards certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner & Solutions Architect and have previously studied Game Design at University.  

Please take some time to look around. My repos can be found further down the page.
